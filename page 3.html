<p>One category of mental illness is eating disorders. They could involve disordered eating patterns and a strong anxiety of putting on weight. Eating disorders have the potential to cause deaths as well as major physical health issues.</p>
<p>The current situation of teenage suicide because of mental health issues (like Eating Disorders and Body Dysmorphia) has tripled in the past 16 years. This is due to the fact of rising social media, which is putting tremendous pressure on the teens and making them feel insecure and unliked and because teenagehood is confusing, they don’t ask adults for help as they are scared of being judged or of being pushed aside.</p>

<li>Bulimia nervosa– This is characterised by vomiting (e.g., forcing oneself to throw up or using laxatives) after binge eating. Bulimia nervosa sufferers frequently have a warped perception of their bodies and a dread of gaining weight.</li>
<li>Binge eating disorder– Binge eating incidents that are followed by emotions of guilt, shame, or worry are what define this. A common stress among those who suffer from binge eating disorder is that once they start, they won't be able to stop.</li>
