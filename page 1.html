<P>  This leads to constant sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities that they once enjoyed. This condition can seriously impact various aspects of their life,like their emotions, behavior,etc.

    There are many symptoms that can be connected back to teen depression. Even though they differ from person to person, a few common symptoms are- 
    <li>Constant/Consistant feelings of sadness or emptiness</li> 
    <li>Changes in appetite or weight (this can also be harmonal and not necessarily connected to depression)</li>
    <li>Feelings of worthlessness and or excessive guilt</li>
    <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
    Again, these sympotoms don't always mean you have depression, but if you are facing more that two of the above sympotoms, I suggest you jest some medical attention (just incase).</p>
    
    <p> This  can be triggered by differnt factors, like environmental stress, hormonal changes, traumatic events, or a combination of few /all of these factors. It is essential to seek professional help if a teenager displays persistent signs of depression, as early help and appropriate treatment can improve their well-being and prevent potential long-term consequences, like suicide.</p>

<P>There are many treatment options for (teenage) depression nowadays. Since, this is the 21th century, there are many painless treatments for depression. Some are-
<li>Psychotherapy: Such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). These treatments (even if they sound scary) have shone positive results. These treatments could help teenagersÂ in developing coping mechanisms, recognising and altering harmful thought patterns, and enhancing their general mental well-being.</li> 
<li>Medication: (In few cases) To aid with the symptoms of depression, medical experts may prescribe antidepressant drugs like serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Teenagers who take medicine need to have their consumption properly monitored, and any possible adverse effects or symptom changes should be regularly examined.(PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THIS MEDICATION)</li>
<li>Family Therapy: It can be beneficial to involve the family in the therapy process since it fosters better family support, communication, and understanding. Any underlying familial issues that can contribute to the teenager'sÂ depression can also be addressed in family therapy. (PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS MIGHT NOT ALWAYS WORK AS A LOT TEENS WHO HAVE DEPRESSION HAVE FAMILY ISSUES)</li>
<li>Changing Daily Routiens: Promoting healthy habits can have a major positive impact on mood and general well-being. of teensÂ These choices include regular exercise, a balanced diet, enough sleep, and stress-reduction strategies. Taking part in hobbies and physical activities can also be a healthy way to vent emotions and decompress.(Depression can also be caused due to harmonal imbalences)</li>
<li>Mindfulness and Relaxation: Teens can improve their general psychological well-being, manage stress, and better regulate their emotions by engaging in mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation exercises. These techniques can also help develop self-awareness and self-compassion, both of which are critical for controlling depressive symptoms.</li>
</P>
And please remember that, no matter how hard things get, YOU ARE NOT ALONE and there are always people out there who love you and care for you and people who can HELP YOU. And remember no matter what the situation is SUICIDE IS NOT AND WILL NEVER BE THE ANSWER. YOU ARE LOVED AND WORTH LIVING IN THIS WORLD ðŸ˜„.
